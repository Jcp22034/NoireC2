# **NoireC2**

A web-UI based C2 server written in Python designed for solo or team-based penetration testers.

Currently in-development (hence the terrible README.md)

It's still in beta, so please report any bugs you find on the [issues page](https://github.com/Jcp2203/NoireC2/issues)

If you are a web developer and are interested in helping with the HTML and web pages, please reach out on the [issues page](https://github.com/Jcp2203/NoireC2/issues) or send a pull request. Many thanks!
